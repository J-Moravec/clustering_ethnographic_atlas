The repeated optimal number of clusters for different penalizations of purity suggest that the purity surface is stable with significant peak. The single/minimal linkage method seems to fail in finding a reasonable optimal number of clusters and while median seems to extract a three clusters, closer inspection of purity curves shows only a small peak and otherwise a similar monotone surface as the single linkage method.\relax }}{1}}
